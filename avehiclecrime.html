As concluded in the analyzed San Francisco crime data, vehicle theft is the fifth most common crime in the area. Larceny/theft and Assault were more frequent violations, while other more common crimes were Non-criminal, or not specified and called “Other offences”. Vehicle theft is often linked to drug crimes and use, which is also the crime observed to be hand in hand in the data (Drug/Narcotic is the sixth most often occurring violation).
