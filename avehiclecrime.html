As concluded in the analyzed San Francisco crime data, vehicle theft is the fifth most common crime in the area. Larceny/theft and Assault were more frequent violations, while other more common crimes were Non-criminal, or not specified and called “Other offences”. Vehicle theft is often linked to drug crimes and use, which is also the crime observed to be hand in hand in the data (Drug/Narcotic is the sixth most often occurring violation).
Ten different regions are displayed on the San Francisco map. The ones with the darkest shade of grey have seen the greatest number of vehicle thefts from 2003 to 2017. In regards to this crime, the district of Ingleside is considered the most dangerous and Tenderloin the safest. The map allows each citizen of San Francisco to explore the vehicle crime activity of their region.

<h2 style="font-size:120%;font-family:Helvetica;">I too, saw a car robbery! </h2>

This story brought the author to the magazine archives. The old interview with the resident of the Ingleside district John Travolta, back in 2005 has emerged. As John mentioned, he had known “at least three or four people who had had their car stolen”. He also vividly explained that vehicles were not always stolen late at night, as one would expect, but in the evenings too. "You would expect thefts to be scared of vitnesses on the streets!", John pondered. He promised, during his evening walk, he saw a car robbery himself once!

While some people tend to invent or re-imagine stories, the data supports John’s claims. Most of the car thefts in San Francisco has happened during the evening hours, and most often at six o’clock in the evening.
