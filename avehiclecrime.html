<h1 style="font-family:garamond; font-size:500%;"> San Francisco: Vehicle Theft</h1>


<br>

<h2 style="font-size:120%;font-family:Helvetica;">In the bustling city of San Francisco, vehicle theft has been a longstanding issue that has plagued the community for decades. As one of the most densely populated cities in the United States, San Francisco is known for its vibrant culture, innovative technology, and stunning architecture. However, this city has also been notorious for its high crime rates, with vehicle theft being the fifth most common crime reported to the police. </h2>

To better understand the distribution of vehicle thefts across San Francisco, we can look at the number of thefts in each of the city's districts. Using data from the Police Department Incident Reports, we have created a choropleth map that highlights the number of vehicle thefts in each district from 2003 to 2017.
<br>
According to the data, the district with the highest number of vehicle thefts is the Ingleside district, located in the southern part of the city, with a total of 20,546 thefts over the course of 14 years. Known for its infamous jail, which was later turned into a college, Ingleside still keeps its reputation for crime to this day. The second highest district in terms of vehicle thefts, is the Mission district, with a total of 17,297 thefts over the same period. The Mission district is located in the south-mid part of the city and is known for its vibrant Latino culture and eclectic mix of restaurants, cafes, and bars. The high number of vehicle thefts in this district can be attributed to its proximity to the Southern District, its high population density, and the large number of vehicles that pass through the area daily. The third highest district in terms of vehicle thefts is the Bayview district, with a total of 16,780 thefts over the same period. The specific reasons for the frequent occurrence of cases may be that Bayview is a community with a strong industrial atmosphere and a diverse community, including African Americans, Asian Americans, and Latin Americans. Many residents face high housing prices and rents, making Bayview a poor community in San Francisco.

Overall, the data shows that the number of vehicle thefts in San Francisco is not evenly distributed across the city's districts. The districts with the highest number of thefts are located in the southeastern and northern parts of the city, while the districts with the lowest number of thefts are located in the western and southern parts of the city.
It is important to note that vehicle theft is a serious crime that can have a significant impact on individuals and communities. By understanding the distribution of vehicle thefts across San Francisco, law enforcement agencies and community leaders can work together to implement targeted interventions and strategies to reduce the incidence of this crime and improve public safety in the city.

The polar bar chart below illustrates the relationship between the time of day and the frequency of vehicle theft incidents in San Francisco between 2003 and 2017. Interestingly, the chart shows that the frequency of vehicle theft varies widely depending on the time of day. Specifically, the frequency of vehicle theft is higher during the night hours, between 18:00 to 23:00, peaking at around 18:00 and gradually decreasing in the early morning hours.

This is consistent with the findings of a report by the National Insurance Crime Bureau, which revealed that most car thefts in the United States occur at night. The report also found that car thefts occur more frequently during the warmer months and that certain cities, such as San Francisco, are more prone to vehicle theft than others. San Franciscans' daily routines vary from person to person, but generally, their work hours are usually from 9:00 to 17:00. Dinner time is typically between 18:00 and 20:00, and the average sunset time in San Francisco is around 8 PM. Therefore, the peak hours for car thefts are between 18:00 and 23:00. The fact that there are fewer incidents during the early morning hours suggests that most car thefts may not be the work of professional criminal organizations and that many of these crimes are likely committed on a whim or in the spur of the moment.
<br>Overall, this graph provides valuable insights into the pattern of vehicle theft in San Francisco, which can help law enforcement agencies and individuals take appropriate measures to prevent car theft and protect their property.

Finally,  the time-series graph below demonstrates the development of vehicle thefts in San Francisco over the years. We can also observe several insightful trends in different districts.

<h2 style="color:grey; font-family:Helvetica; font-style:italic; font-size:12px">The line graph displays the trends in vehicle thefts in different districts of San Francisco over the period of 2003 to 2017. The data used in this graph is obtained from the San Francisco Police Department's Incident Reports from 2003 to 2017. The graph is based on the number of vehicle thefts reported in each district of San Francisco over the years.</h2>

Overall, in 2006, there was a significant decrease in the number of vehicle thefts across all districts. As stated by law enforcement officials in the state of California, it is caused by increasingly aggressive technologies to combat crime [3]. It could also be supported by increasing police patrols and crackdowns, raising public awareness of vehicle security, increasing the use of surveillance technology, and promoting the use of vehicle theft prevention devices. Additionally, the economic situation at the time may have also contributed to the decrease in vehicle theft rates, as a prosperous economy could reduce the demand for crime and the number of people engaged in criminal activities. Therefore, the reasons for the decrease in vehicle theft rates in all districts of San Francisco in 2006 may be diverse.
<br>
<br>

However, a slight increase in vehicle crime can be observed in 2012, which has been convincingly tied to the realignment in the state of California [1]. In addition, there was also a noticeable increase in vehicle thefts in 2015, which may have been caused by the fact that in 2014 the San Francisco Police Department launched a new program called the "Bait Car Program." Under this program, the police department would leave a car with the engine running and the keys in the ignition in an area with a high rate of vehicle theft. When someone tried to steal the car, the police would be alerted and would make an arrest.

<br>
The overall trends in vehicle theft vary across the different districts in San Francisco. The districts of SOUTHERN, RICHMOND, and CENTRAL show a similar pattern, with 1000 to 1500 cases in 2003 and 2004, followed by a significant drop in 2006, and then minor fluctuations between 2006 and 2014, with a slight increase in 2015 and subsequent return to normal levels. The districts of TARAVAL, BAYVIEW, NORTHERN, and MISSION have similar trends to the above three districts, but with higher numbers each year, ranging from 1800 to 2500 cases at their highest. However, two districts show abnormal trends. INGLESIDE consistently has the highest number of cases, with an unusual surge in 2012, which could be related to the previously mentioned realignment in the state of California. TENDERLOIN consistently has the lowest number of cases and also experienced a drop in 2006, maintaining a stable and low case count throughout the years. The reason for the lowest crime rate could the fact that it is on of the poorest neighbourhoods in San Francisco with many residents relying on low-income jobs or social assistance. Additionally, the area has the smallest land area, so there are very few vehicles.

<br>

In conclusion, the line graph above provides insights into the trends in vehicle thefts in different districts of San Francisco from 2003 to 2017. The graph shows that the overall trend is that vehicle thefts have been decreasing steadily over the years. This can be attributed to various factors, including policy changes and technological advancements. It is interesting to observe the different trends in different districts and the impact of external factors such as the Bait Car Program and advancements in car security technology

<br>

However, to conclude the article, some also believe that the carelessness of the people is playing an important role in the recent increases in crime rates. People more and more often, due to technology induced convenience, forget the car keys inside the vehicle, which allows for easy theft [2]. Hence, stay alert and take care of each other. And others' vehicles.
