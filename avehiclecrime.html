<h1 style="font-family:garamond; font-size:500%;"> San Francisco: Vehicle Theft</h1>



<h2 style="font-size:120%;font-family:Helvetica;">In the bustling city of San Francisco, vehicle theft has been a longstanding issue that has plagued the community for decades. As one of the most densely populated cities in the United States, San Francisco is known for its vibrant culture, innovative technology, and stunning architecture. However, this city has also been notorious for its high crime rates, with vehicle theft being the fifth most common crime reported to the police. </h2>

To better understand the distribution of vehicle thefts across San Francisco, we can look at the number of thefts in each of the city's districts. Using data from the Police Department Incident Reports, we have created a choropleth map that highlights the number of vehicle thefts in each district from 2003 to 2017.
According to the data, the district with the highest number of vehicle thefts is the Ingleside district, located in the southern part of the city, with a total of 20,546 thefts over the course of 14 years. Known for its infamous jail, which was later turned into a college, Ingleside still keeps its reputation for crime to this day. The second highest district in terms of vehicle thefts, is the Mission district, with a total of 17,297 thefts over the same period. The Mission district is located in the south-mid part of the city and is known for its vibrant Latino culture and eclectic mix of restaurants, cafes, and bars. The high number of vehicle thefts in this district can be attributed to its proximity to the Southern District, its high population density, and the large number of vehicles that pass through the area daily. The third highest district in terms of vehicle thefts is the Bayview district, with a total of 16,780 thefts over the same period. The specific reasons for the frequent occurrence of cases may be that Bayview is a community with a strong industrial atmosphere and a diverse community, including African Americans, Asian Americans, and Latin Americans. Many residents face high housing prices and rents, making Bayview a poor community in San Francisco.

Overall, the data shows that the number of vehicle thefts in San Francisco is not evenly distributed across the city's districts. The districts with the highest number of thefts are located in the southeastern and northern parts of the city, while the districts with the lowest number of thefts are located in the western and southern parts of the city.
It is important to note that vehicle theft is a serious crime that can have a significant impact on individuals and communities. By understanding the distribution of vehicle thefts across San Francisco, law enforcement agencies and community leaders can work together to implement targeted interventions and strategies to reduce the incidence of this crime and improve public safety in the city.

This story brought the author to the magazine archives. The old interview with the resident of the Ingleside district John Travolta, back in 2005 has emerged. As John mentioned, he had known “at least three or four people who had had their car stolen”. He also vividly explained that vehicles were not always stolen late at night, as one would expect, but in the evenings too. "You would expect thefts to be scared of vitnesses on the streets!", John pondered. He promised, during his evening walk, he saw a car robbery himself once!

While some people tend to invent or re-imagine stories, the data supports John’s claims. Most of the car thefts in San Francisco has happened during the evening hours, and most often at six o’clock in the evening.
